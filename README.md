# project_579: RAG

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a framework to give generative models knowledge without finetuning themselves. In this way, an LLM can adapt to new tasks quickly with the presence of new documents.

1. Install packages:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Run the following in the terminal:
    python test.py --pdf_file "paper.pdf"

3. If the script runs successfully, then you will see the following messages:
