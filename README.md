# project_579: RAG

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a framework to give generative models knowledge without finetuning themselves. In this way, an LLM can adapt to new tasks quickly with the presence of new documents.

1. Install packages:
   
    pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the following in the terminal:
   
    python main_final.py --pdf_file "paper.pdf"

4. If the script runs successfully, then you will see the following messages:
   
    Connected to database successfully
   
    Indexing successfully
